<h3 id="brain-dump">Brain Dump</h3>
<p>I do not recall being approached or harrassed by unpleasant strangers. I seem
to get weird encounter stories everytime I go somewhere (although that has
mainly been in the US or Canada). It almost always happens in public transit.
In Japan, everyone is quiet and minds their business.</p>
<p>Speaking of transit, transit there is nice. I want it here in the US. It makes
places walkable and a lot of places were packed full of different things to
explore. The zoning laws seem amazing. Meanwhile, in the US, most places are so
far apart that you would need a car.</p>
<p>Transit does get packed however, especially in Tokyo. I recall two awkward
incidents where I wanted to move just an inch of my body, but I was not able
to without disturbing others.</p>
<p>Even though there is a higher density of people in Japan, there is not that
much noise. I did mention people in transit being silent, but I also notice
that there is less ambient noise.</p>
<p>Food here was great. A lot of places offer good food for a decent price
compared to the US. People say that the average food in Japan is better, but I
cannot say I definitely agree. However, I would say that the average price to
food goodness is better (compared to the US).</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I moved around A LOT. Yea haha, I think it was fine.
I liked it.</p>
<p>The weather sucked. It was super hot and humid. It also rained. It was raining
during our planned time of reaching the Mount Fuji summit. We already climbed
like 80% of the way and decided to go back down. That sucked.</p>
<p>I also suck at Japanese. I was being carried by my friends. I need to be better.</p>
