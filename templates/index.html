Welcome to my page.
</h3>
<p>
My name is Timmy and I currently study computer science (6-3) at MIT. I like
learning about programming languages, operating systems, and distributed
systems. I also enjoy wasting time ricing my Linux setup, but I don't do it as
much these days; perhaps my configuration is good enough.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I guess I write stuff here too.
