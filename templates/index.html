Welcome to my page.
</h3>

<p>
My name is Timmy and I am currently at MIT pursing my M.Eng. I recently got my
S.B. studying computer science (6-3, also at MIT). I like learning about
programming languages, operating systems, and distributed systems. I also enjoy
wasting time configuring stuff. I spend more time configuring for a task rather
than spending time doing the task itself.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I guess I try to write stuff here too.
