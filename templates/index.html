Welcome to my page.
</h3>

<p>Hi, I am Timmy. I currently reside in the Bay Area and do engineering at <a
  href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>. I recently got my M.Eng and S.B.
studying computer science at MIT (I played for the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3069522">osu!</a> team there!).
I like learning about programming languages, operating systems, and distributed systems. 
I also enjoy wasting time configuring stuff. I spend more time configuring for a task rather than
spending time doing the task itself. </p>

<p>
Oh, I guess I try to write stuff here too.
</p>
