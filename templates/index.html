Welcome to my page.
</h3>

<p>
Hi, I am Timmy. I currently reside in North Carolina. I recently got my
M.Eng and S.B. studying computer science at MIT. I like learning about
programming languages, operating systems, and distributed systems. I also enjoy
wasting time configuring stuff. I spend more time configuring for a task rather
than spending time doing the task itself.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I guess I try to write stuff here too.
